I am an entreprenuerial-minded Mechanical Engineering graduate from McGill University living in Montreal and working internationally.

Since graduating in May 2014, I've had two impactful experiences. First, I joined team at publicaly traded startup Knight Therapeutics as employee #3. Knight raised $355 million on the Toronto Stock Exchange during my tenure. Second, I was selected into the Next 36, where I attempted to launch a technology venture. We failed to get it off the ground for a couple of reasons and closed up shop in the fall of 2015.

To broaden my experiences, I'm excited to be joining McKinsey & Company's Montreal office in January 2016 where I'll learn about efficiency and influence while working with some amazing people in a high-pressure environment.
