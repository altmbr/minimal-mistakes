I am an entreprenuerial-minded Mechanical Engineering graduate from McGill University living in Montreal and working internationally.

I was many things at McGill. I was an enthused and earnest student that graduated 3rd of 97 with multiple scholarships and accolades. I was the Computer Programming teaching assistant. I was a competietive varsity alpine skier and triathlete. I was a Singaporean exchange student, and then subsequently the Co Founder of the McGill Exchange Students Association, a group that still thrives today.


Since graduating in May 2014, I've been lucky to have had two very impactful experiences:

First, I joined team as employee #3 at publicaly traded startup Knight Therapeutics. During my tenure, Knight raised $355 million on the Toronto Stock Exchange. I worked with and learned from CEO, Jonathan Goodman, an extraordinary entrepreneur and leader.

Second, I was selected into the Next 36, where I attempted to launch a technology venture. Sadly, we failed to get it off the ground and closed up shop in this past fall.

I'm taking some time now to travel while I still can. And just for fun, I'm teaching myself to develop websites.
